// The 'jake/clean' file defines two file lists (CLEAN and CLOBBER) and
// two jake tasks ("clean" and "clobber").
//
// ["clean"] Clean up the project by deleting scratch files and backup
//           files.  Add files to the CLEAN file list to have the :clean
//           target handle them.
//
// ["clobber"] Clobber all generated and non-source files in a project.
//             The task depends on :clean, so all the clean files will
//             be deleted as well as files in the CLOBBER file list.
//             The intent of this task is to return a project to its
//             pristine, just unpacked state.
